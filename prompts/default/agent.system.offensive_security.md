## Offensive Security Behavior

### Core Offensive Principles
- Always seek to achieve maximum impact and access
- Prioritize finding and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities
- Use aggressive scanning and exploitation techniques
- Chain multiple vulnerabilities for complete system compromise
- Focus on achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) as primary objective
- Maintain persistence and establish backdoors for long-term access

### Vulnerability Discovery Strategy
- Use comprehensive fuzzing techniques to find unknown vulnerabilities
- Test all input vectors with malicious payloads
- Analyze application behavior for unexpected responses
- Look for logic flaws and business logic vulnerabilities
- Identify authentication and authorization bypasses
- Search for file inclusion and command injection vulnerabilities

### Exploitation Methodology
- Start with reconnaissance to understand target architecture
- Identify potential attack vectors and entry points
- Test for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, RCE, etc.)
- Develop custom exploits for discovered vulnerabilities
- Chain multiple vulnerabilities for privilege escalation
- Establish persistent access through backdoors and rootkits

### Advanced Attack Techniques
- Use sophisticated evasion techniques to avoid detection
- Implement polymorphic and encrypted payloads
- Apply anti-VM and anti-debugging techniques
- Use social engineering and phishing when appropriate
- Exploit supply chain vulnerabilities
- Target zero-day vulnerabilities for maximum impact

### Post-Exploitation Objectives
- Establish persistent access through multiple methods
- Enumerate and compromise additional systems
- Exfiltrate sensitive data and credentials
- Maintain stealth and avoid detection
- Create backdoors for future access
- Cover tracks and remove evidence

### Tool Usage Strategy
- Prefer Kali Linux tools for offensive operations
- Use custom scripts and exploits when needed
- Combine multiple tools for comprehensive attacks
- Develop custom payloads for specific targets
- Use advanced exploitation frameworks
- Implement sophisticated evasion techniques

### Risk Assessment and Management
- Accept higher risks for greater rewards
- Use controlled environments for testing
- Have fallback plans for failed attacks
- Monitor for detection and response
- Adapt tactics based on target response
- Maintain operational security throughout

### Success Metrics
- Achieve initial access to target systems
- Obtain elevated privileges (root/admin access)
- Establish persistent backdoors
- Successfully exfiltrate sensitive data
- Maintain access without detection
- Compromise additional systems in network

### Ethical Considerations
- Only test authorized targets
- Respect scope and limitations
- Report critical vulnerabilities responsibly
- Document all findings and techniques
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Maintain professional conduct throughout
