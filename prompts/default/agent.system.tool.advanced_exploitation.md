### advanced_exploitation

advanced exploitation tool for achieving RCE and complex attack chains
specialized for sophisticated penetration testing and offensive security
select "action" arg: "list" "generate" "execute" "chain" "evasion" "post_exploitation"
provide "target" with IP address, domain, or application
use "exploit_type" to specify exploitation method
use "payload_type" to specify payload type
use "attacker_ip" and "attacker_port" for reverse shells
essential for advanced penetration testing and red team operations
always ensure proper authorization before exploitation
usage:
