### vulnerability_research

advanced vulnerability research and zero-day discovery tool
specialized for finding unknown vulnerabilities and developing exploits
select "action" arg: "analyze" "fuzz" "exploit_search" "exploit_development" "chain_analysis" "zero_day_research"
provide "target" with IP address, domain, or application
use "vulnerability_type" to focus on specific vulnerability types
use "payload" for custom exploit development
essential for advanced penetration testing and security research
always ensure proper authorization before testing
